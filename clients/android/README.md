# Tuvima Android clients

This Gradle workspace contains the shared API/authentication layer, the Android
TV pilot, the phone/tablet application, and the Android Auto media service.

Requirements: JDK 17, Android SDK 37, Gradle 9.3.1, and an Android device or
emulator. CI installs the pinned toolchain. This Windows checkout does not
currently have a local Android toolchain.

Build from this directory with `gradle :tv:assembleDebug :mobile:assembleDebug`.
Never place signing keys, service credentials, bearer tokens, or signed media
URLs in this repository.

Orientation: the phone app is locked to portrait (`screenOrientation="portrait"` on
`MainActivity`); TV is landscape by nature. Movies and episodes rotate to landscape, Photos clips follow
the phone, and everything else stays portrait. The rule lives in `core` `OrientationPolicy`.

Video: Play on a movie or episode (and on a downloaded one in Downloads) opens `VideoPlayerActivity`, a
full-screen landscape player. It shows the same ExoPlayer the media service owns through a Media3
`MediaController`, so the lock screen, headset buttons, offline progress and the audio notification stay in one
place, and starting a video pauses music. It sends custom session commands (`PLAY_VIDEO`, `CANCEL_VIDEO`) to the
service, which resolves the manifest, waits while the Engine prepares a stream (every 2 seconds, up to 2
minutes, with Cancel), and resumes at the Engine's saved position. The activity handles rotation itself, so
turning the phone never restarts playback; closing it returns to the portrait main screen. Leaving the screen
pauses (no background audio for video). A refused title (403 or 404, such as a Kids limit) reads "This title is
not available for this profile."; a lost connection reads "Can't reach your Tuvima server" with Retry. While a
streamed item (audio or video) plays, the service sends a heartbeat every 15 seconds and on pause, stop and end;
downloaded items keep their on-phone progress path. The choice between the video screen and the audio service is
`PlaybackRouting` in `core`. No gestures, track pickers, speed or chapter lists yet.

Video: the phone app declares MKV and M4V containers and SRT subtitles, and the playback manifest now
carries audio tracks, subtitle tracks, chapters and skip segments (`PlaybackTrackPicker` chooses the
starting tracks from the profile's language preferences).

Unit tests for the shared client (API v1 paths, typed profile-switch results, photo consent, photo grid layout,
and the offline download rules: server-won detection, replay order, the storage cap, expiry and report results,
plus kept photos: the cap with photos, the purge rule, kinds and the gallery plan)
run with `gradle :core:testDebugUnitTest`. They use plain JUnit and cover logic that needs no Android
framework; wire-shape parsing needs the Android JSON classes and is not yet covered by JVM unit tests.
